1. We use w3css as our main style.
2. index.html -> The menu of the app.
3. app.js -> The general global class for the app (App) -> contains usefull stuff
4. every page (menu, pages, connections ...) has its own controller-js -> registering events, loading data and classes as needed.
5. every page (menu, pages, connections ...) loads the app.js first.
6. The global class/namespace "Author" is our encapsulation for Book, App, etc. So everything will be "Author.*" see app.js
